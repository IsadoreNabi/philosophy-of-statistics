## 1. Problem & Motivation: A Topology-First Guardrail

Many workflows jump straight into smoothing, imputation, or global trend estimation **without** checking whether the data behave as a single connected system. **topologyR** elevates local metric information (adjacent distances) into neighborhoods → base → full topology, then poses a decisive question: *Is the induced topology connected?* If **yes**, global continuity assumptions are supported; if **no**, you must **segment** and analyze components separately. This is the package’s central guardrail and value proposition.&#x20;

Concretely, topologyR provides a pipeline to: (i) build subbases/bases from numeric data with tunable thresholds, (ii) derive the induced topology and quantify its complexity, (iii) run undirected/directed/coverage connectivity checks, and (iv) explore how threshold choices change structure.&#x20;

## 2. Formal Definitions

**Topological space.** Given a set $X$, a topology $\tau$ on $X$ is a family of subsets (the *open* sets) that contains $\emptyset$ and $X$ and is closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections; $(X,\tau)$ is a **topological space**.&#x20;

**Base & subbase (intuitive).** From data, we form **neighborhoods** under a threshold $\tau$ (not the topology!), take **finite intersections** to form a **base**, and from unions of base elements obtain the **full topology**. In topologyR this is done explicitly from a numeric vector.&#x20;

**Connectivity (β₀).** We study whether the induced topology connects all present indices under either undirected or directed reachability, or at least **covers** all indices (manual check).&#x20;

## 3. topologyR Pipeline: What the package builds for you?

1. **Neighborhoods** under a tunable threshold (e.g., IQR-based)

2. **Base** via intersections (include empty/full sets for correctness)

3. **Full topology** from the base (closure under unions/finite intersections)

4. **Connectivity** checks: undirected DFS, directed DFS, manual coverage

5. **Threshold exploration** (mean/median diffs, SD, IQR/factor, DBSCAN-like) and **factor sweep** summaries/plots &#x20;

A compact R-sketch of the core algorithm appears below (the package implements a robust version):&#x20;

```r
# Neighborhoods under τ
subbase <- lapply(seq_along(x), function(i) which(abs(x - x[i]) <= τ))

# Base: include ∅ and X
base <- list(integer(0), seq_along(x))
for (i in seq_along(x)) for (j in i:length(x)) {
  S <- intersect(subbase[[i]], subbase[[j]])
  if (length(S) > 0) base <- c(base, list(S))
}
base <- unique(base)

# From the base -> topology (unions/finite intersections)
# Connectivity checks:
# is_topology_connected(topology)         # undirected DFS
# is_topology_connected2(topology)        # directed DFS (sequential)
# is_topology_connected_manual(topology)  # coverage 1..n
```

## 4. Key Innovation

### 4.1. Revealing Topological Invariants to Validate Imputation Methods

#### 4.1.1. Introduction: The Fundamental Problem

We often assume global continuity (smoothing, kriging, splines, etc.) **before** verifying whether continuity is even mathematically defensible. topologyR fixes this by elevating local distances into a topology and reading off invariants (notably **connectedness**) that decide method validity.&#x20;

#### 4.1.2. Conceptual Foundations

**4.1.2.1. The Nature of The Problem.** Sequential data hide global properties critical for method choice: system connectivity, structural complexity, and breakpoints that may invalidate continuity. These are not visible from pairwise distances alone.&#x20;

**4.1.2.2. The Topological Solution.**

1. Metric proximity → **neighborhood relations**
2. Neighborhoods → **subbase**
3. Intersections/unions → **base** and **full topology**
4. Topology → **invariants** (connectivity) that govern method validity.&#x20;

#### 4.1.3. The Theoretical Framework: Connectivity ⇒ Method Validity

**Case I: Connected Topology.** Valid to use global continuous methods (polynomial/linear interpolation, cubic splines, kriging/geostatistics, moving averages, continuous kernels), assuming adequate sampling/noise.&#x20;

**Case II: Disconnected topology.** Global continuity is invalid; you must switch to **segment-wise** or **regime** approaches (independent imputation per component, regime-switching, conditional-by-segment, hot-deck within component, finite mixtures).&#x20;

#### 4.1.4. Global vs Local Properties

**Global** properties (full-period means, secular trend, systemic volatility, cycle structure, cointegration, long memory, global neural synchrony, centennial climate trends, circulation patterns) **require** connectivity; a disconnected topology invalidates global continuous imputation across the break. **Local** properties (short-window volatility, local derivatives, local clustering, AR(1)/AR(2) at short lags, local inflection points, short-segment spectra) can be analyzed per component regardless of global connectedness. &#x20;

#### 4.1.5. Critical Applications by Domain

* **Econometrics.** Disconnections mark structural crises; avoid trends that cross discontinuities.
* **Medicine/Neuroscience.** Interventions can split regimes; test continuity before longitudinal pooling.
* **Climatology.** Extreme events can sever continuity; don’t extrapolate trends across regimes.&#x20;

#### 4.1.6. Fundamental Decision Rule

1. Global analyses: **connectivity is necessary** for continuous methods.
2. Local analyses: use continuous methods **within each component**.
3. Mixed: segment globally; apply local continuous tools inside each segment.&#x20;

#### 4.1.7. Conclusions On the Fundamental Contribution

topologyR transforms imputation from heuristic to **mathematically grounded** procedure by revealing the underlying topological structure that justifies (or forbids) continuity assumptions before application — crucial in policy, biomedical, and climate contexts.&#x20;

#### 4.1.8. Positioning vs General-Purpose TDA

Focus: 1D series, **β₀** (connectedness), explicit decision rule. Complement PH stacks (Ripser/GUDHI/TDAstats/scikit-TDA) for multi-scale/higher-β structure (no explicit imputation rule).&#x20;

#### 4.1.9. Limitations and Risks

1. **Parameter Sensitivity** (threshold choice) → mitigate via factor sweeps; still empirical.

2. **Sampling/noise** can mimic (dis)connection → treat “connected ⇒ continuous” as **prima facie**.

3. **Expressivity** limited to **β₀**.

4. **Scalability**: exhaustive builds can be $O(n^2)$.&#x20;

#### 4.1.10. Global conclusions & practical guidance

Use topologyR as a **pre-model governance** tool for binary **validity** decisions; complement with PH for subtle multi-scale features that don’t break global connectedness.&#x20;

## 5. Scope & Typical Use Cases

* **Economic & other time series**: connectivity regimes, structural breaks.
* **Signal/biological data**: neighborhood graphs, coverage checks.
* **Didactic**: bases/subbases, topology construction, graph↔topology bridges.&#x20;

## 6. Design Principles

Correctness (include ∅ and $X$; track coverage), transparency (step-wise functions), explorability (fast heuristics & visuals for threshold selection).&#x20;

## 7. Technical Approach: Algorithms & Connectivity Engines

**Core Algorithm** and **Methods** (undirected DFS; directed sequential DFS; manual coverage) as sketched in §3 above.&#x20;

**Connectivity Functions (Package Internals).**

* `is_topology_connected()` builds a symmetric adjacency from set co-membership and runs DFS over present elements.

* `is_topology_connected2()` directs edges along sorted, consecutive elements within each set and DFSs from the minimum.

* `is_topology_connected_manual()` checks whether each original index 1..n appears in at least one set.   &#x20;

## 8. API at A Glance (Quick Start)

```r
library(topologyR)

# Small example vector
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Build a complete topology and check connectivity
topo     <- complete_topology(x)
undirected <- is_topology_connected(topo$topology)
directed   <- is_topology_connected2(topo$topology)
manual     <- is_topology_connected_manual(topo$topology)

# Threshold exploration and factor sweep
ths <- calculate_thresholds(x)
res <- analyze_topology_factors(x, factors = c(1, 2, 4, 8, 16))
viz <- visualize_topology_thresholds(x)  # optional visuals
```

## 9. Threshold Heuristics & Factor Sweep

You can derive τ from **mean/median adjacent differences**, **SD**, **IQR / factor**, or a **DBSCAN-like** heuristic; then run an **IQR-factor sweep** (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16) and track **base size / set sizes** to pick a stable regime. &#x20;

Internally, the factor sweep computes $\tau=\mathrm{IQR}(x)/f$, builds subbases, forms the base (with ∅ and $X$), and summarizes base size and min/max set sizes per $f$. &#x20;

```r
set.seed(1)
x <- cumsum(rnorm(200))

ths  <- calculate_thresholds(x)
resf <- analyze_topology_factors(x, factors = c(2, 4, 8, 16), plot = FALSE)

print(ths)
print(resf)
```

## 10. Performance & Scalability

Exact neighborhood/base construction can grow as $O(n^2)$; prefer robust thresholds + factor sweeps, and consider down-sampling beyond moderate $n$. For first-pass diagnostics on very large data, use the **manual coverage** check and then refine with directed DFS as needed. &#x20;

## 11. Limitations & Validity Notes

* **Threshold Sensitivity**: false (dis)connections if τ is mis-set → mitigate with grids, but keep domain judgment.

* **Sampling/noise**: sparse sampling may mimic disconnections; light overlaps may mimic connection → treat “connected ⇒ continuous” as **prima facie**, not absolute.

* **Expressivity**: emphasis on **β₀**; higher-order features require PH stacks.

* **Assumptions**: sequential indices 1..n; very large topologies can be memory-intensive. &#x20;

## 12. End-To-End Example: Imputation Decision

```r
library(topologyR)
x <- as.numeric(AirPassengers)

# Transparent, robust default for τ and illustrative factor sweep
ths  <- calculate_thresholds(x)
res  <- analyze_topology_factors(x, factors = c(2,4,8,16), plot = FALSE)

tau  <- IQR(x)/4
topo <- complete_topology(x)  # for small n; otherwise use thresholded subbases

is_conn <- is_topology_connected(topo$topology)
if (is_conn) {
  message("Connected: using global continuous imputation.")
  # e.g., stats::spline(...), global kriging, smoothers
} else {
  message("Disconnected: segment-wise imputation & regime models.")
  # split by connected components; impute/model per segment
}
```

## 13. Positioning vs. General-Purpose TDA

topologyR is a **focused**, decision-oriented pre-model tool for **1D series** (β₀/connectedness). For multi-scale/higher-β structure or early-warning signals, complement with **Ripser/GUDHI/TDAstats/scikit-TDA**.&#x20;
